# Comprehensive National Nutrition Analysis (2016-2018)

## Overview  
This project provides an in-depth analysis of India's **Comprehensive National Nutrition Survey (CNNS)** conducted between 2016-18. It highlights key insights into the nutritional status, micronutrient deficiencies, and malnutrition trends among children and adolescents in India. The dashboard delivers actionable data for policymakers, healthcare professionals, and other stakeholders.  

## Dataset Source  
The dataset used in this project is sourced from the **[Comprehensive National Nutrition Survey](https://ndap.niti.gov.in/collection/Comprehensive%20National%20Nutrition%20Survey%20(CNNS)/10)**.
